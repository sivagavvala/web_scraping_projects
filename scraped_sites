All Indian Highcourts URLs for scraping cases in asynchronous way using Arsenic webdriver were implemented as part of performance improvement of existing sequential crawlers.
URLs that I have written scripts for scraping are mentioned below:

https://elegalix.allahabadhighcourt.in/elegalix/WebStartCaseSearch.do
https://www.calcuttahighcourt.gov.in/Order-Judgments
https://highcourt.cg.gov.in/hcbspjudgement/query/jud_status.php?chopt=O
http://gujarathc-casestatus.nic.in/gujarathc/#
https://hphighcourt.nic.in/#
http://karnatakajudiciary.kar.nic.in:8080/repository/rep_judgmentcase.php
https://hckinfo.kerala.gov.in/digicourt/Casedetailssearch/Statuscaseno
http://patnahighcourt.gov.in/CaseSeachByCNR.aspx
https://www.phhc.gov.in/home.php?search_param=judgement
https://hcraj.nic.in/cishcraj-jp/
https://hcraj.nic.in/cishcraj-jdp/
https://hcs.gov.in/hcs/hcourt/hg_case_search

All captchas that were present in this URLs were scraped too and developed a deep learning model to predict the solution with 99% accuracy.
